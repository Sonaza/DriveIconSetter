# Drive Icon Setter for Windows

This software can be used to easily set hard drive icons visible in Windows Explorer. 

Supported icon formats are .ico and .png. Any other image format is not supported.

The icons should have square aspect ratio (width equal to height) or stretching may occur.

The icon files used for the drives will be copied to `C:\ProgramData\DriveIconSetter` for storage.

This software requires Administrator's permissions to modify registry keys in:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\DriveIcons`

Happy tweaking!
